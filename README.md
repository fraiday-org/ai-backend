# AI Backend

## Application Architecture

The AI Backend is a FastAPI-based application designed to provide chat and semantic search capabilities with a focus on AI-powered interactions. Below is an overview of the key architectural components.

## System Overview

The application is built using a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **API Layer**: FastAPI-based REST API endpoints
- **Service Layer**: Business logic implementation
- **Data Layer**: MongoDB for data persistence
- **Background Tasks**: Asynchronous processing for non-blocking operations
- **Event Processing**: Event-driven architecture for handling system events

## Core Components

### API Layer

The API is organized into versioned endpoints (v1) with the following main resources:

- **Chat**: Manages chat sessions and messages
  - Chat Sessions
  - Chat Messages
  - Chat Message Feedback
  - Chat Session Recaps
- **Client Management**: 
  - Client Configuration
  - Client Channels
  - Client Data Stores
- **Semantic Layer**:
  - Repositories
  - Semantic Server
  - Data Store Sync Jobs
- **Events**:
  - Event Processor Configuration
- **Health**: System health monitoring

### Service Layer

Services implement the core business logic:

- **AI Service**: Integration with AI models for chat processing
- **Analysis Services**: Data and conversation analysis
- **Chat Services**: Chat session and message management
- **Client Services**: Client-related operations
- **Event Services**: Event processing and delivery
- **Webhook Services**: External system integration

### Data Layer

The application uses MongoDB for data persistence with the following key models:

- **Chat Models**:
  - Chat Message
  - Chat Session
  - Chat Message Analysis
  - Chat Message Feedback
  - Chat Session Recap
- **Client Models**:
  - Client
  - Client Channel
  - Client Data Store
  - Client DB Server
- **Semantic Layer Models**:
  - Various models for semantic search functionality
- **Event Models**:
  - Event tracking and processing models

### Background Tasks

The system uses background tasks for operations that should not block the main request flow:

- **Chat Tasks**: Asynchronous processing of chat-related operations
- **Event Tasks**: Event delivery and processing
- **Semantic Layer Tasks**: Data synchronization and indexing

### Event Processing

The application implements an event-driven architecture for handling system events:

- Event configuration
- Event delivery tracking
- Event processing and routing

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **AI Integration**: AI Backend Orchestrator

## Deployment

The application is containerized and can be deployed using Docker. Environment configuration is managed through environment variables defined in `.env` files.
